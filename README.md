# INTRODUCTION
Users can explore the complex links between meteorite mass, year of occurrence, recclass, and fall type through well designed graphics. A wide range of tools are available on streamlit, such as dynamic mass range selector, year range slider for temporal research, and multi-select widgets for recclass and fall type. It is separated into three tabs, tells a compelling story. 

It begins with a line graph that shows the relationship between meteorite mass and year.
The bar graph that classifies meteorite masses, and
ends with an eye-catching world map that shows the locations of meteorite landings throughout the world. 

This multipurpose instrument not only enables users to identify trends in meteorite data but also prompts them to consider the spatial details of astronomical contacts on Earth.

# Data Source
Meteorite Landing data : https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/data_preview

# Future Work
Add details on particular events, meteorite composition, impact energy, or other information to the already-existing dataset. This may offer more thorough insights into the properties of certain meteorites.

By adding sophisticated geospatial features, you can expand the geographic analysis. For deeper context, this could entail connecting with external geographic databases, assessing spatial patterns, or clustering meteorite landings.
